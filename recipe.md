RECIPE FOR MY YUMMY CAKE--

1.Mix dry ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  Set aside.
2.Cream the butter and sugar: Beat with an electric hand mixer (or stand mixer) the buttermilk, sugar, yogurt, olive oil, and vanilla until well combined, about 2 -3 minutes.
3.Mix dry and wet: Add flour mixture to the batter 1/3 at a time, letting the flour incorporate with each addition and continue mixing just until well combined. Please do not overmix.
4.Add the strawberries: Foil in the chopped strawberries, saving a few strawberries (about a cup) to decorate the top of the cake.
5.Transfer batter to prepared pan and arrange saved strawberries on top, if desired.
6.Bake for 45-55 minutes (depending on your oven) or until itâ€™s golden brown and firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
